1. In the first notebook we construct various search algorithms and apply them to find the best path in square grid $N\times N$.
2. In the second notebook we construct a simple Movie Recommendation System, using Prolog. Specifically, we firstly create a Knowledge Base and some *rules*. Then we are able to perform queries and recommend movies based on the plot, the actors, the director, e.t.c.. Lasty, given two users and together with their ratings for various movies, we perform more recommendations, based on these ratings.
